Smart Farming Assistant
Overview
Smart Farming Assistant is an innovative solution that leverages advanced technology to help farmers enhance productivity and make informed decisions. The platform features a Smart Crop Recommendation system powered by machine learning, suggesting optimal crops based on soil nutrients, climate, and historical data. Additionally, it includes a Plant Disease Identification tool using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to diagnose plant diseases from images, enabling timely interventions.

Other key features include real-time Weather Forecasts, tailored Fertilizer Recommendations based on soil quality and crop requirements, and a Smart Farming Guide for efficient crop management. With a user-friendly web application, farmers can easily access these insights to optimize their farming practices.

Research Paper
This project is based on the research paper published on IEEE: IEEE: Smart Crop Recommendation System with Plant Disease Identification View Paper

Crop Recommendation Model
The Crop Recommendation Model employs machine learning algorithms to suggest the best crops based on environmental and soil factors. It analyzes soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall to provide tailored recommendations. Among seven classification algorithms tested, Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 99.55%, ensuring reliable crop selection.

Dataset
Rows: 2200

Columns: 8 (Nitrogen, Phosphorous, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall, and Crop Label)

Goal: Predict the best crop based on soil and environmental conditions.

Model Architecture
